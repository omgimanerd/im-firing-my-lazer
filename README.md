# im-firing-my-lazer
This repository contains code used in our laser scanning modern physics project
at Stuyvesant High School

# Dependencies
To replicate this project with scanner data, this project requires pyserial
```
sudo pip install pyserial
```

To run the analyses on the data, this project requires numpy, scipy,
and matplotlib.
```
sudo pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
```


Resolutions are measured in lines per mm.

Scanning speed at 60rpm = 1.57 in/s

Theoretical resolution, 0.024 in / motor tick
